## 🧪 Advanced AI/ML Features

### 1. **Automatic Feedback Generation**
- **Customer Sentiment Analysis**: Real-time emotion detection
- **Behavioral Pattern Recognition**: Thank-you detection, frustration signals
- **Resolution Success Tracking**: Issue resolution keywords and patterns
- **Response Time Optimization**: Sub-3-second response reward system
- **Escalation Prevention**: Automatic detection and reward for self-resolution

### 2. **Multi-Armed Bandit Optimization**
```python
# Exploration vs Exploitation balance
action = bandit.select_action()  # ε-greedy strategy
reward = customer_interaction(action)
bandit.update(action, reward)  # Learn from feedback
```

### 3. **Q-Learning State-Action Optimization**
```python
# State includes customer context
state = RLState(
    communication_style=customer.style,
    urgency_level=message.urgency,
    customer_sentiment=sentiment_score,
    interaction_count=history.count,
    customer_tier=customer.tier
)

# RL chooses optimal response strategy
action = q_agent.select_action(state)
```

### 4. **RAG Knowledge Integration**
- **6 Business Knowledge Documents**: Account management, billing, technical support, features, troubleshooting, security
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Automatic document processing and embedding
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based knowledge retrieval
- **Context Ranking**: Relevance scoring for response generation

## 📊 Performance & Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
